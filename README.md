# Channel Structures Benchmark

This repository contains benchmarks for writing to channels with different struct types in Go. The benchmarks focus on comparing the performance of writing to channels with structs directly (`WriteToChannel`) versus writing pointers to structs (`WritePointerToChannel`).

## Purpose

The purpose of these benchmarks is to evaluate the performance implications of using channels with different types of struct values. In Go, channels are a fundamental part of concurrent programming, allowing communication and synchronization between goroutines. However, the choice of struct type when writing to channels can impact performance, especially when dealing with heavier struct types.

## Benchmark Results

### `BenchmarkWritePointerToChannel`
```
BenchmarkWritePointerToChannel-12
13797 72578 ns/op 320 B/op 1 allocs/op
PASS
```

This benchmark measures the performance of writing pointers to a heavy struct (`*HeavyStruct`) to a channel. It indicates that on average, each operation takes approximately 72.578 microseconds. The benchmark also reports memory usage of 320 bytes per operation and 1 allocation per operation.

### `BenchmarkWriteToChannel`

```
BenchmarkWriteToChannel-12
17966 84046 ns/op 320 B/op 1 allocs/op
PASS
```

This benchmark measures the performance of writing heavy structs (`HeavyStruct`) directly to a channel. It indicates that on average, each operation takes approximately 84.046 microseconds. Similar to the previous benchmark, it reports memory usage of 320 bytes per operation and 1 allocation per operation.

## Interpretation

- **Performance Comparison**: Both benchmarks show comparable performance, with writing pointers to structs being slightly faster than writing the structs directly to the channel. However, the difference is relatively small.

- **Memory Usage**: Both benchmarks report the same memory usage, indicating that the memory overhead of using pointers is not significantly different from using the structs directly.

- **Allocations**: Both benchmarks report a single allocation per operation, suggesting that the number of memory allocations is not influenced by the choice of struct type when writing to channels.

## Conclusion

Based on these benchmark results, there isn't a significant performance difference between writing pointers to structs and writing the structs directly to channels. However, it's essential to consider other factors such as code readability, maintainability, and ease of use when making decisions about struct types in concurrent Go programs.
